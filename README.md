App for learning languages


I'm making this app for the [Anton Brejestovski's](https://www.brejestovski.com) Language School, but it can be used for other lessons as well. 

Lessons are contain texts and exercises. 
Collections of lessons are stored in Firestore database. Downloaded lessons and student's submissions are stored in the CoreData.

Doing exercises is the main function of this app. 
Student can (and encouraged to) input his answer by the voice. App checks the answer word by word, but student can mark his answer by himself if this check fails.

App remindes to repeat lessons twice: after three and seven days.
